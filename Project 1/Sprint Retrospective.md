# Sprint Retrospective

Initial set-up of the automation code went well and got stuck on just a few coding errors, but overall it was successful and was done in a reasonable timeframe. All documents are completed and the tests were done on time.

Documentation needs to be improved. I need to remember to update all related documents as the project is ongoing. Like the RTM, Jira board, and feature files are related and all need to be updated when one changes. There should be a better initial creation of test cases.

A few more test cases need to be tested to cover other edge cases for next sprint. Better time management on things to do. Better documentation as well so everything is up to date.

# Acceptance Testing Summary

## User story 1

### As a new user I want to open an account with the Planetarium so I can save my celestial findings

The service shows a link for create a account and brings you to a page the indicates entering a username and password. The link for create a account is very small compared to the other fields. The username and password requirements are not being shown so the user would have no idea how to make a valid one. The service fails when providing a non-unique username. The design is just a plain textbox with black background. The overall score would be a 2 for ok for the reasons above.

## User Story 2
### As a user I want to securely access my account so I can interact with the Planetarium in a secure environment
The service is intuitive enough as the page shows you are at the login with the username and password fields, and the login button to be clicked. It is easy to use as you only have to type in your credentials. The service does not allow you to login with invalid credentials. The design is the same with registration, just a plain textbox with a black background. The overall score would be a 3 for good as it serves the purpose of a login without much issues apart from the simplistic design.

## User Story 3
### As a user I want to see my planets and moons added to the Planetarium so I can track my findings
The service is simple as it only displays the resources available to the user. It is easy enough to use but its design needs more to it. Since the moons are owned by planets, it would have been better if they were under the planets there owned by or at least right after it. The overall score would be 3 for good since it serves its purpose and only a few nitpicks on how it displays its contents.

## User Story 4
### As a user I want to add new planets and moons to the Planetarium so I can update my findings
The service is okay on intuitiveness. Adding more labels to the fields would make it clearer on what their purpose is. It is easy to use as just pick your selection from the dropdown then type in the details required. There were a few problems on its basic functionality of adding planets and moons. More specifically the file type of png is not accepted for images which the wireframe indicates it should accept. Design is okay, alignment of the top page looks off relative to the other fields. Overall score would be a 1 due to failing basic requirements for its functionality.

## User Story 5
### As a user I want to remove planets and moons from the Planetarium so I can correct my findings
Like in user story 4, the service would be better if there were labels to its fields. This user story also failed in its requirement of being able to delete planets and moons that you own. This definitely brings the overall score to a 1.
